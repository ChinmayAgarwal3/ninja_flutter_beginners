This project is complete.
It was a tutorial based project by net ninja called "Flutter for Beginners", this is the 1st project in the series, upto episode 16.

With this project I have completely understood the UI basics of flutter development and the concept of stateful and stateless widgets

This is a single page application and i am completely capable of creating more SPAs from now on !!!


Congratulations on Milestone 1 on the Flutter Development Roadtrack
